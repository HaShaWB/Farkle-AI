## 3. Scoring System

### 3.1 Single Dice

- **One 1**: 100 points
- **One 5**: 50 points

### 3.2 Multiple Dice of the Same Value (Kind)

- **3 of a kind**: Face value × 100 points (except for 1, which scores 1,000 points)
    - Example: Three 2's → 200 points, Three 3's → 300 points, Three 1's → 1,000 points
- **4 of a kind**: Score for 3 of a kind × 2
    - Example: Four 2's → 400 points
- **5 of a kind**: Score for 4 of a kind × 2
    - Example: Five 2's → 800 points
- **6 of a kind**: Score for 5 of a kind × 2
    - Example: Six 2's → 1,600 points

### 3.3 Straight

- **Five consecutive numbers**: 1,000 points (e.g., 2-3-4-5-6)
- **Six consecutive numbers**: 2,500 points (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5-6)

### 3.4 Three Pairs

- Three pairs of different numbers: 1,500 points

### 3.5 Two Triplets

- Sum of the scores of each 3 of a kind
    - Example: (2,2,2) + (5,5,5) → 200 + 500 = 700 points
